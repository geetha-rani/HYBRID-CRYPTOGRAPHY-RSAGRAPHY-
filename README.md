# HYBRID-CRYPTOGRAPHY-RSAGRAPHY

The branch of **“ASYMMETRIC Cryptography”**. It is a combination of PUBLIC-KEY cryptosystem and SYMMETRIC-KEY cryptosystem.
Public-key cryptosystems are convenient in that they do not require the sender and receiver to share a common secret in order to communicate
securely. They often rely on complicated mathematical computations and are thus generally much more inefficient than comparable symmetric-key cryptosystems.
Constructed using any 2 separate cryptosystems ***KEY ENCAPSULATION SCHEME (public-key)*** & ***DATA ENCAPSULATION SCHEME (symmetric-key)***
